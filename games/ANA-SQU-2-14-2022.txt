(A one-pass-away off ball players like to rotate towards/above the ball, and it looks like they're aiming for their man to go above the ball to not be in the way of the drive; however, they just bring their guy into the ball, and their driving angle is shit, because they're moving at a slight angle away from the hoop, and they're not even using the DHO as a screen because of how high they go. A 14 does this right here)
